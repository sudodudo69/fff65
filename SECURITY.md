## Report a security issue

The project team welcomes security reports and is committed to providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be reported privately via [the new security issue reporting process](https://example.com/security/report).

## Security advisories

Remediation of security vulnerabilities is prioritized by the project team. The project team endeavors to coordinate remediation with third-party stakeholders, and is committed to transparency in the disclosure process. The team announces security issues via [GitHub](https://github.com/your_org/your_project/releases) as well as [RustSec](https://rustsec.org/new_advisories/) on a best-effort basis.

Note that communications related to security issues in Fastly-maintained OSS as described here are distinct from [Your Organization's Security Advisories](https://your_org.com/security-advisories).
